**1. Structure Motif Search using PDB**  
Following the standards in the Rosetta manual, candidate structures were screened. After downloading, multi-chain structures were separated, non-protein components were removed, and structures were relaxed to construct a scaffold library.

**2. Side Chain Graft using Rosetta**  
Side chains were grafted onto the scaffolds using Rosetta.

**3. High-scoring Structures after Screening**

**4. Post-processing Docking and Binding Site Comparison (Preliminary Validation)**
